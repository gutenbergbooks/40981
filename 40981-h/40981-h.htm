      Your late zealous exertion against the infidels, in procuring the Sunday
      Bill to be passed, and prosecutions and pillory against infidel writers
      and publishers, must have convinced them that you are in earnest in your
      attempts to propagate and establish our holy faith. An act of parliament
      is an excellent engine for producing that kind of uniformity of opinions,
      which consists in holding the tongue; and, however unfair it may be in
      common transactions to suppress the arguments on one side of any question,
      yet, in religious matters, even the most cool and charitable must allow,
      that it is otherwise. When the salvation of men is concerned, every means
      is justifiable. What right has a man to complain, though by virtue of an
      act of parliament, by pains and penalties, fines, imprisonment, and the
      pillory, he may be sent to heaven whether he will or no? It is carrying
      the notion of liberty too far, to suppose, because we are free-born
      Englishmen, that we may choose our own faith and go to heaven <i>our own
      way!</i> What would become of the right reverend and reverend guides and
      turnpike-men, if people were permitted to avoid the strait gate and go to
      their journey's end without paying?
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreigners are so sensible of this, and the priests of other countries are
      so tenacious of their rights of directing the intellects of the people,
      that they have invented and deposited in the inner chambers of the holy
      inquisition, a number of most ingenious machines, which, by means of
      whips, cords, pullies, screws, wheels, iron crows, red hot pincers, and
      the like, are found to be extremely serviceable in twisting and warping
      opinions to any settled models government may require.

      Notwithstanding your Lordships' readiness* "to oppose error of every kind
      by argument and persuasion," it happens unfortunately for us, that these
      mechanical and persuasive arguments are unknown in <i>Britain</i>. Instead
      of that most strong and logical argument, called the torture, we are
      obliged to adopt plain reason, or, at most, when that fails us, the <i>prison,
      fine, and pillory</i>. But, it is to be hoped, that the happy time is not
      far off, when the priests of <i>Britain</i> may be able to argue with as
      much force as the spiritual directors of other countries; when the Clergy
      may approach the throne, and avow their readiness to stop the mouths of
      men, without being under the shameful necessity of contradicting
      themselves, by "disavowing all violence in the cause of religion.*"

      In those better days, the Lord Bishop of Chester may overthrow the
      arguments of an infidel peer, by declaring them "unworthy of a Reply;" and
      the Bishop of St. David may confirm the defeat, by affirming, that the
      arguments of unbelievers "deserve no answer;" for every one will then say,
      they "would not" answer them, not that they "could not," as they impiously
      affirm at present. But as those glorious times are not yet arrived, we
      must be contented, in the mean while, to proceed in the old method of
      reasoning upon even ground with our adversaries. The weak, though <i>zealous
      Christian</i>, who has the honour, to address your Lordships on the
      present occasion, has presumed to lay before you a few of the Doubts of
      the Infidels, and he hopes you will answer them to his entire
      satisfaction.* He is happy in reflecting that the late act of parliament
      forbids them to speak; but his satisfaction is infinitely greater when he
      assures himself, that your Lordships' answer will convince them and make

    <h2>
      DOUBTS OF INFIDELS,
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. How can <i>the attributes</i> of God be vindicated, in having performed
      so great a number of miracles, for a long succession of very distant ages,
      and so few in <i>latter times?</i> If they were performed for the
      instruction of those times only, are they not equally necessary at present
      for us? or, if those ancient miracles were intended likewise for our
      instruction, are they adequate to the purpose? Can God, who gave us
      reason, act inconsistently with its dictates; and is it rational or fair
      to demand our belief of things, which are in their own nature far removed
      from common belief, or common sense, and require something more than the
      usual testimony of history for their support? When Livy affirms,* that the
      Gauls conspired against Hannibal, we admit and believe the fact; but when
      in the same chapter he speaks of shields sweating blood, of its raining
      hot stones at Arpi, and the like, we justly reject and disbelieve these
      improbable assertions; neither is any credit given to the account of the
      wonderful method of curing diseases by the touch, said to be possessed by
      Mr. Greatrix,* though we find it in the Philosophical Transactions. The
      miracles of the Old Testament were all performed in those ages of which we
      have no credible history; what reply then can be made to those who affirm,
      that miracles have always been confined to the early and fabulous times;
      that all nations have had them, but that they disappeared in proportion as
      men became enlightened, and capable of discovering <i>imposture</i> and <i>priestcraft</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * T. Livii, lib. xxii, cap. 1.
</pre>
    <p>
      2. Suppose a book to be published, containing assertions of historical
      facts long past, which had no collateral testimony of other authors;
      suppose those facts in general to be improbable and incredible; suppose
      the book to be anonymous, or, which is worse, ushered into the world under
      the name of a person who, from the internal evidence of the thing, could
      not have written it; can it be imagined, that such a book would find
      credit among people, who have the least pretensions to reason or common
      sense? Which, then, is the readiest way of confuting the enemies of our
      holy and only true religion, who do not scruple to affirm, that many books
      of canonical Scripture are in this predicament? They observe that the
      books of the Pentateuch bear many strong marks of an author long posterior
      to Moses; that the book of Numbers** quotes the book of the Wars of the
      Lord, which, as first written, was most probably the book which Moses
      wrote; that Moses could not possibly have written the account of his own
      <i>death and burial</i> in Deuteronomy,**** which nevertheless has no mark
      to distinguish it from the rest of the book.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Lowther's Abridgement, Vol. III. p. II. Greatrix published
     a pamphlet, to which the attestations of Boyle, Wilkins,
     Cud-worth, and many other great men were affixed. Vide Life
     of St. Evremont, printed with his works in English, 3 vols.
     8vo.

     ** Numb. xxi. 14.

     *** Deut. xxxiv.
</pre>
    <p>
      And supposing these and other objections of the like nature to be removed,
      what must we say in reply to their remark, that the Scripture, which we
      believe to be dictated by the inspiration of the unerring God, is
      frequently** contradictory with regard to facts, and very often represents
      the all-wise Creator*** as angry, repenting, unjust, arbitrary, &amp;c.
      and that consequently we must either give up that dependence, which we
      naturally place on his goodness and rectitude, or reject those writings
      which represent him as a demon. Do not your Lordships apprehend, that, for
      want of better arguments, we shall be under the necessity of recurring to
      the <i>argumentum pillorii</i>, or of adopting some of those <i>gentle
      methods</i> which were lawfully used for the conversion of heretics in the
      mild and pious reign of Mary, Queen of England?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     ** Vide infra.

     *** Genesis vi. 6,7. also Exod. vii. 3. xi. 9,10. and 1 Sam.
     xv. 35.
</pre>
    <p>
      3. Is the account of the creation and fall of man, in the book of Genesis,
      physical or allegorical? Did God create light before the sun? How could he
      divide the light from darkness, since darkness is nothing but the mere
      privation of light? How could time be divided into days, before the
      creation of the sun, since a day is the time between sun-rise and
      sun-rise? How could the firmament be created, since there is no <i>firmament</i>,
      and the false notion of its existence is no more than an imagination of
      the ancient Grecians?
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The Scriptures were certainly written for the purpose of being
      understood, or for no purpose at all. A mystery, that is to say, an
      assertion or theorem, which the human understanding is incapable of
      comprehending, must likewise be inexpressible in human speech; we cannot,
      therefore, avail ourselves of the short and elegant method of clearing and
      elucidating difficult parts of Scripture, by the use of the word mystery,
      but how shall we, without this <i>happy resource</i>, explain the business
      of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, of a speaking serpent, and of a
      tree of life, which God was obliged to guard by cherubim and a flaming
      sword, lest man should eat of the fruit and become immortal?
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The serpent was afflicted with the curse of going upon his belly. The
      scoffers seem to think it no curse at all; for as they take it for granted
      that he went upon his back before this unfortunate transaction, they
      apprehended it was doing him a singular piece of service to reverse him,
      the latter position being evidently the most convenient. They also take
      notice, that no animal can subsist upon dust, and that whatever the
      individual serpent in question might have done, the serpents of modern
      times are so profane, that they universally reject so dry a food, and, by
      a second act of impiety, emancipate themselves from the consequences of
      the first.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Gen. vi.&mdash;78.
</pre>
    <p>
      6. The account of the flood is very embarrassing. It is described as the
      effects of natural agents in the hands of God. It rained; no mention is
      made of waters created for the purpose. The deluge was universal; all the
      high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered; and it ceased,
      not by the annihilation of the waters, but they were evaporated by a wind.
      Now from whence came the water? The weight of the whole atmosphere, with
      all its vapours, is equal to no more than a hollow sphere of three or four
      and thirty feet thickness, environing the whole globe, and consequently
      the whole of its contents, if condensed into water, could not deluge the
      earth to the height of an ordinary house. It is to no purpose to break
      open the fountains of the abyss, or great deep, if any such fountains
      there are; for gravity would prevent the waters from issuing out; neither
      can we easily persuade infidels, that the windows of Heaven were opened,
      while they know it has no windows; so that we have but three or four and
      thirty feet of water to deluge the highest mountains, some of which are
      more than fifteen thousand feet high.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Indian Alps are 20,862 feet above the level of the
     ocean. Editor.  See Col. Kirkpatrick's History of Nepaul,
     and Asiatic Researches, Vol. VIII.
</pre>
    <p>
      7. The weak in faith find themselves equally at a loss respecting the ark.
      It seems strange to them, that so vast an assemblage of animals could be
      inclosed in an ark or chest, which had but one window, (which window was
      kept shut for more than five months,) without being stifled for want of
      air: it appears equally remarkable that Noah and his three sons could
      unstow and serve out the daily allowance of provisions and water to the
      passengers; and if their wives were supposed to help them, the work to be
      done is still prodigious. The lions and other carnivorous animals must
      have lived on salt provisions; which, no doubt, they were glad of, as
      seafaring people are not very nice, especially in long voyages.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. If God set his bow in the clouds, as a token of his covenant with
      mankind after the flood, ought we not to conclude, that he, at that time,
      established the law of the various refrangibility and reflexibility of the
      rays of light, and consequently, that before the flood many optical
      experiments, which are common with us, would not then have succeeded? For
      example, a man could not have made a rainbow by spouting water out of his
      mouth; Mr. Dollond's achromatic telescopes would have then been no better
      than common ones; natural bodies must have appeared all of one colour,
      &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. What answer must we give to those who are inclined to deny, that an
      all-powerful and just God could make use of the most unjustifiable means
      to attain his great purpose of aggrandizing the posterity of Abraham?
      Could this benevolent and just Being approve of the ungenerous advantage
      which Jacob took over his faint and hungry brother? Could this omnipotent
      and upright Spirit adopt no method of distinguishing his favourite Jacob,
      but that of fraud and lies, by which he deprived the same unsuspecting
      brother of his father's blessing? Or, in short, how shall we justify God
      for the continual distinction and favour he is said to have bestowed on a
      people, who from their own annals appear to have been unparalleled for
      cruelty,* ingratitude, inurbanity, &amp;c.?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * See the acts of Joshua; also 1 Sam. xv. &amp;c.
</pre>
    <p>
      10. When the unbelievers affirm that a just God could not punish Pharaoh
      for an hardness of heart of which he himself (God) was evidently the
      cause, we usually answer, that the potter has power over the day to
      fashion it as he lists; but when in reply, they take notice, that if the
      clay in the hands of the potter were capable of happiness or misery,
      according to the fashion impressed on it, the potter must be malevolent
      and cruel who can give the preference to inflicting pain instead of
      happiness, then we are obliged to be silent, in hopes that your Lordships
      will condescend to supply us with better arguments than any we are
      acquainted with at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Miracles must have been very common in Egypt, since there was a body
      of people whose trade it was to work them. When Aaron's rod was turned
      into a serpent,* Pharaoh, instead of being surprised at it, as an unusual
      phænomenon, sends for his magicians, who immediately perform the like with
      their rods. Your Lordships owe us some little explanation concerning this
      business: we know it is our duty to believe, that Aaron's miracle was
      performed by the power of God, but are at a loss to discover by what power
      the magicians performed theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. When** Aaron turned the waters of Egypt into blood, their streams,
      their rivers, their ponds, and all their pools, together with all the
      water throughout the land of Egypt, whether in Vessels of wood, or vessels
      of stone, the magicians of Egypt did so likewise with their enchantments.
      Here again our adversaries, who unfortunately have more curiosity than
      faith, take the liberty to enquire, whether the magicians formed water to
      practise their art upon, since Aaron had already turned it into blood?
    </p>

     ** Exod. vii. 10.

     *** Exod. vii. 10, &amp;c.
</pre>
    <p>
      13. Pharaoh still continuing inflexible, though successively exposed to
      the plagues of frogs, lice, and flies;* his cattle, namely, the horses,
      the asses, the camels, the oxen, and the sheep, were afflicted with a very
      grievous murrain, and all the cattle of Egypt died, except those of the
      children of Israel.** This producing no good effect with Pharaoh, the
      whole nation of Egyptians were plagued with boils and blains;***
      notwithstanding which Pharaoh's heart continued as hard as ever.**** Moses
      was therefore sent early in the morning, to advise Pharaoh to send for his
      cattle, and all that he had in the field, and shelter them against a
      terrible hail storm, the approach of which he predicted. They among
      Pharaoh's servants who feared the word of the Lord, saved their cattle and
      servants, by removing them into houses; for the next day came on a storm
      of thunder, lightning, and hail, which broke the trees, destroyed the
      herbage, and killed every living creature that was in the field, excepting
      only that in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there
      was no hail. <i>Divine truths</i> are so different from those which carnal
      minds are used to contemplate, that it must be very difficult by the force
      of mere human reason to persuade mankind in general, that Pharaoh's cattle
      were in any great danger from the hail storm, since they were all
      previously dead by the murrain; and some people are so stupid, that they
      think killing them a second time was no punishment at all. There are not
      wonting some amongst the present perverse generation; who are at a loss to
      conceive how those of Pharaoh's servants, who feared the word of the Lord,
      could make their Cattle flee into houses, since they pretend to maintain,
      that cattle already dead, whether by the murrain or otherwise, are
      incapable of fleeing. Notwithstanding those people are so obviously in the
      wrong, yet we depend upon your Lordships, that you will expose their
      errors in more glaring colours than any in which they have yet appeared.

      14. Some weak believers are in doubts whether so mean, so ungenerous, and
      so dishonest an act, as borrowing the jewels of the Egyptians* without any
      intention of returning them, did not rather originate in that disposition
      which characterizes the Jews to this day, than in the command of the just
      God, who certainly could need no such tricks to accomplish his intentions.

      15. The plague of hail being succeeded by locusts, thick darkness, and the
      death of all the first-born of Egypt, cattle included, Pharaoh at length
      permitted the Israelites to depart; but afterwards repenting, he went in
      pursuit of them** with six hundred chariots and all the horses and
      chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them by
      the sea, near Baal Zephon. The Red Sea was parted in two to afford a
      passage for the Israelites, the Egyptians followed them, and were punished
      for their rashness by the return of the waters, which swallowed them up.
      Here again our petulant and unsatisfied opposers demand how Pharaoh could
      pursue with chariots and horsemen, since his horses were all slain twice
      over, once by the murrain and once by the hail; not to mention that the
      first born of cattle were slain even a third time. They likewise add, that
      Egypt, which, to facilitate the dispersion of the waters of the
      overflowing Nile, is intersected by numberless canals, must have always
      been a very improper country either for cavalry or chariots.

      call thee, rise up and go with them."* Balaam accordingly rose up, saddled
      his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. "But God's anger was kindled
      because he went," insomuch that he sent an angel to oppose him, who would
      certainly have slain him, if the ass he rode on had not exhibited a
      specimen of penetration and prudence, of which the asses of modern times
      seem to be divested. The infidels here insist, that it is better to reject
      the whole story, than to believe that the Supreme Being could be angry
      with Balaam, merely because he obeyed his command; but the true believers,
      the sons of the church, who think there would be no exercise for our
      faith, if we were required to admit nothing but what can be supported by
      argument, are not at all concerned in this difficulty; the more improbable

      17. "The Lord was with Judah,** and he drove out the inhabitants of the
      mountains, but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because
      they had chariots of iron." It is difficult to conceive, how the Lord of
      heaven and earth, who had so often changed the order, and suspended the
      established laws of nature in favour of his people the Jews, could not
      succeed against the inhabitants of a valley, because they had chariots of
      iron! Or ought we not rather to infer that the book in which this passage
      is found, has nothing of divine inspiration in it, but was written by one
      of the Jews who considered the God of Israel their protector as a local
      divinity; who was in some instances more, and in others less powerful,
      than the gods of their enemies. Thus David in many places compares the
      Lord with other gods "The Lord is a great God, and a great king above all
      gods," &amp;c. and Jephtha says to the king of the children of Ammon,
      "Wilt thou not possess that which Chemosh thy God giveth thee, to possess?
      So whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us, them will
      we possess."

      in converting the natives of Peru and Mexico to the Christian religion!***
      It is true, they ripped up women with child, dashed infants to pieces
      against the rocks, and broiled men to death with slow fires; but as their
      pious intention was purely that of delivering these uninstructed and
      ignorant people from the more horrible pains of futurity, the truly
      compassionate can not but approve their conduct. How can we enough admire

      wanted zeal to join in the pious work, and even wished to leave the
      Indians in possession of certain imaginary blessings which he pretended to
      call "the rights of humanity!" But the holy ardour of his associates
      frustrated his impious attempts; he could do no more than write, yet his
      writings, so far from producing the effect he intended, only served to
      increase our admiration of those great characters he meant to stigmatize.
      If the comparison might be allowed, we may affirm that the Spaniards were
      inferior to the Jews in this only circumstance, that they had a Las Casas
      among them. The Jews were obdurate to a man, and hardened with holy
      cruelty. We hear of no tergiversation when Jericho was to be destroyed;
      "Man and woman, young and old, ox, sheep, and ass, were put to the edge of
      the sword."* What a philosophical command over the tender passions must

      20. In the last battle of Saul with the Philistines* near Gilboa, Saul
      being sorely wounded, requested his armour-bearer to draw his sword, and
      run him through, but his armour-bearer would not; therefore Saul took a
      sword and fell upon it; and when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead,
      he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.** David was at this
      time returned from the pursuit of the Amalekites, when, on the third day
      after Saul's death, a young man came out of the camp from Saul, with his
      clothes rent, and earth upon his head. He brought the news of Saul's
      death, the circumstances of which, upon David's enquiry, he reported to
      be, that coming by chance upon Mount Gilboa, he beheld that Saul leaned on
      his spear, and that the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
      Saul looking behind him, called the young man, and requested him to slay
      him: so I stood upon him, said the young man, and slew him, because I was
      sure he could not live after he was fallen; and I took the crown that was
      on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them
      hither unto my lord. David rewarded the mistaken compassion of this young
      man, by commanding him to be put to death.

      How do our adversaries, the infidels, exclaim against the barbarity of
      David, when they read this melancholy history! What! say they, is this the
      mild, the merciful David? Is this the man after God's own heart? Is he not
      rather the tyrant&mdash;the inhuman despot? What effort of holy zeal could
      stimulate him to murder the young man, who had performed the last offices
      of humanity to Saul; who, in the agonies of death, had himself besought
      him to put an end to his lingering miseries? Why should this idol of the
      Christians, this man after God's own heart, embrue his hands in the blood
      of the youth, who supposed he had done a charitable office to the deserted
      and expiring monarch, whom this David pretended to lament, and who, at the
      same time, gave such endearing proofs of loyalty to him himself, by
      presenting him with the regal ornaments? But we, the faithful, who can
      easily explain all scripture mysteries, say, that though David was really
      one of the greatest of sinners, yet he truly repented him before he died.
      Our enemies, the unbelievers, say no; that it is false, and they quote the

      They say if David ever repented, or was ever truly pious, we shall

      death bed. There, say they, it is to be hoped, we shall find him forgiving
      his enemies, and dying in charity with all mankind. This is what all
      mankind in general make a point of doing, from the saint to the
      malefactor. David, therefore, must certainly give us an extraordinary
      instance of his attention to this important evidence of contrition.

      But what shall we think, say these enemies of our holy religion, when we
      see this Nero of the Hebrews, this man after God's own heart, this idol of
      the Christians, die in a manner uniform and consistent with the whole
      course of his life? What will be our reflections, when we find him, with
      his last accents, delivering two cruel and inhuman murders in charge to
      his son Solomon? Murders still farther aggravated by the included crimes
      of ingratitude and perjury! One of them to be executed on his old and
      faithful general, Joab, who powerfully assisted him on all occasions, and
      who adhered to him in all his extremities; till at the last, when he had
      justifiable cause of chagrin, but who, notwithstanding, had not appeared
      in actual hostility against him, but only drank a glass of wine with the
      malcontents. His other charge was against Shimea, who reviled David at his
      retreat from Jerusalem, during his son Absalom's rebellion; but who made
      his submission to him when he returned victorious, and whose pardon David
      had sealed with a solemn oath. All these commands, say the infidels, were
      executed in a manner truly worthy the son of such a father! These,
      Christians, say our enemies, are the outlines of the life of a Jew, whom,
      according to the Book of Books, or, more properly speaking, priestcraft,

      21. David commanded that the children of Judah should be taught the use of
      the bow: behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher.* Many difficulties
      arise here about the Book of Jasher. It was extant previous to the writing
      the Book of Joshua,** the author of that book quoting it, and by the
      foregoing text it appears, it was not finished till after the accession of
      David to the throne of Israel. Now, if Joshua wrote the account of his own
      transactions, as is generally believed, the author of Jasher must have
      lived upwards of four hundred years; and if the Book of Joshua was not
      written till after the time of David, and by an unknown author, the
      infidels will affirm, that it comes under the description which is at the
      beginning of the second of these questions. And the misfortune is, we do

      remove this, among many Other very great difficulties, now your long

      and Judah;* but afterwards, being probably ignorant by whose instigation
      he had acted, he repented of the deed. This repentance did not excuse him
      in the sight of the Lord, who offered him to chuse either, "seven years"
      famine, three months defeat before his enemies, or three days pestilence.
    </p>
    <p>
      David chose the latter, and seventy thousand men died. This memorable
      event has not escaped the inspired penman of the Book of Chronicles,** who
      affirms, "that Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number
      them;" but God was displeased with this thing, and therefore smote Israel.
      David repenting, was offered from God his choice, either "three years

      pestilence the latter of which he chose, and there died of Israel seventy

      They beg to be informed, whether the Lord, and Satan, be one and the same
      person; and if not, which of the two was the instigator of this unhappy,
      business, and likewise which of the two "infallible" and "inspired"
      writers tells the lie? Lastly, they cannot conceive how the seven years
      famine in the Book of Samuel is dwindled into three in the Chronicles. To
      all these questions we answer, that it was sufficient to make this action
      of David's criminal, that the Lord disliked it after it was done; and as
      to its being done by his instigation, we must observe, that it is no
      uncommon thing for the Lord to be angry with his servants for obeying his

      which leaves it to the discretion of the faithful to act as they think
      proper. It is true, that this position leads immediately to the doctrines
      of the Jesuits, which have been so universally abhorred: but why need we
      regard the abhorrence of the world, while we are convinced that our tenets
      are scriptural? With regard to the affairs of Satan and the Lord, we leave
      it to your Lordships' management; but cannot help observing with derision,
      the futility of the objections respecting the three and seven years'
      famine. They have little skill in divine arithmetic, if this affords them
      any embarrassment. They know nothing of the sublime logic by which divines
      prove three to be one, and one to be three. For example, if it were
      affirmed that Eldon is a Lord, Castlereagh is a Lord, and Sidmouth is a
      Lord, and yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord, this would be termed
      absolute and ridiculous nonsense, notwithstanding their close Ministerial

      is erroneously taught in our schools, appears in its affording no rule by
      which the two genealogies of Jesus Christ may be reconciled to each other.
      Matthew reckons twenty-seven generations from David to Christ. Luke
      reckons forty-two; and the names totally disagree. Matthew traces the
      descent from Solomon, and Luke from Nathan, both sons of David. According
      to our feeble notions, twenty-seven cannot be equal to forty-two, neither
      can Nathan, &amp;c. be imagined to be Solomon, &amp;c. The infidels
      suppose, that the two evangelists, rather than the church should be
      without the genealogy of its founder, chose to invent them; but we good
      Christians, who know that both writers were infallible and inspired, are
      ready to reject the clearest axioms of mere human science, and allow that,
      in sacred matters, the greater number may be equal to the less. These
      cavillers and infidels also demand how these genealogies of Joseph prove,
      that Jesus was the son of David, when it is avowed that Joseph was not his
      father? But they do not consider, that a married man is obliged to father
      all the children his wife may produce; and if this answer does not satisfy
      them, they must at all events confess, that Joseph was father-in-law to
      Jesus, by being married to his mother; consequently Jesus was son (in-law)
      to Joseph, Q. E. D. As there is no answering for the perverseness of men,
      there may perhaps be some, whom even this demonstration will not satisfy.
      To these we offer an argument discovered by the truly profound Mr.
      Pascal.* He justly observes, that when two witnesses disagree in the
      circumstances of a fact, we ought to believe them so much the more readily
      on that account, as it shews that they did not contrive the story in
      concert. This remark, it is to be hoped, will likewise put an end to the
      absurd custom which prevails in our courts of justice, of discrediting
      evidences, which, contradict each other, such contradictions being in

      mistaken candour of these antients* have allowed them to interpolate no
      more than one paragraph concerning Jesus into the text of Josephus. Would
      it not shew our superior zeal, and be of infinite service to posterity, if
      some divine of the present age would incorporate the whole narrative of
      Matthew into the same text? But, alas, the sneers of our adversaries, the
      unbelievers, have prevailed too much, and good works, like these, are now
      no more!

      26. About eighteen centuries ago, (according to the prophecy of Christ and
      his apostle Paul,** the sun was darkened, the moon ceased to give light,
      and the stars fell from heaven; the sign of the Son of Man was seen, the
      Lord himself descended from heaven with a shout, the trumpets of the
      archangels were heard, the dead in Christ arose, St. Paul and others of
      the elect, who were then living, were caught up in the clouds, went to
      meet the Lord in the air, and have been with him ever since. It is truly
      astonishing, that a phenomenon so awful as the destruction of the system
      of nature should have made no interruption in the state of nations and
      affairs at that time, that all the historians should omit to record so
      dreadful an event, nay, that they should survive it; and that the
      primitive fathers should forbear to mention a circumstance which was so
      well calculated to establish the Christian religion, and confute all the
      arguments of the Jews, heathens, and unbelievers. When your Lordships set
      about the great work of rectifying antient histories, you will doubtless
      be careful to insert an account of this tremendous occurrence; for
      Christians can have no doubt but that it really happened, since it was so
      directly foretold both in time and circumstances, by Christ and his
      apostle Paul.

      27. The oracles of Delphos were obscure and capable of various
      interpretations, but the prophecies of sacred writ are all so clear and
      obvious, they shine so bright by their own native lustre, that no one has
      ever pretended to doubt their divine origin, except those infidels who are
      unfortunately blinded by the too great suffusion of light, which the
      Scriptures so continually emit. If the gift of curing the blind be not
      entirely lost among the apostles of the present day, it must be Christian
      charity to describe the symptoms of their disorder, that your Lordships
      may attempt the cure. These unfortunate people observe, that God said to
      Adam concerning the tree of knowledge of good and evil,* "In the day that
      thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die;" he transgressed, and,
      nevertheless, lived at least eight hundred years afterwards. They observe,
      that the great evangelical prophet Isaiah,* could foresee the downfall of
      Babylon by Cyrus, but could not tell the name of the Messiah, though his
      coming was an event of infinitely greater consequence; nay, they even
      charge him with a blunder, if we admit the opinion, that Christ was
      intended by the names, Mahershalal-hash-baz and Immanuel,** since he was
      never called by them. But they impiously solve this, difficulty, by
      affirming, that Isaiah might take the advantage of writing his prophecy
      concerning Cyrus after the events took place, but could not avail himself
      of the same pious cunning in the affair of the Messiah. And, in fact, we,
      the true believers, are in great want of evidence to overthrow their
      supposition. They demand, if the prophecies be so evident and clear, so
      different from those of the Heathens, how happened it that the whole
      Jewish nation, then living, together with the angel Gabriel, should
      mistake, and suppose the kingdom of the Messiah to be temporal; and that
      it should not be discovered that his kingdom was not of this world, until
      his enemies, the unbelievers, had prevailed and sent him out of it? They
      ask, whether those inspired writers who prophesied concerning things of no
      consequence, as the thirty pieces of silver, and the casting lots for his
      garments, could not, with equal certainty, have predicted the more
      important circumstances of his death and resurrection? In short, they beg
      to be shewn a single prophecy concerning which divines are agreed, and
      desire to know why, in the days of gospel light, the great prophecy of
      John the Divine should be more obscure and enigmatical than any which was
      written during the typical and shadowy dispensation of Moses? All which
      absurd questions your Lordships will, no doubt, answer, overthrow, and
      expose in the most palpable manner, to the great joy of us weak
      Christians.

      28. How came it to pass, say our enemies, the cavillers and unbelievers,
      that Jesus, the Son of God, should curse a fig-tree* for being without
      fruit in March; was he, by whom the world was made,** ignorant that it was
      not the season for figs? They likewise demand, whether it was by design or
      mistake that he affirmed*** that wheat does not produce fruit unless it
      first die? If Scripture was not meant to instruct philosophers, yet why
      should it mislead them? But though these infidels may please to assert,
      that wheat in our days is governed by laws directly contrary to these, as
      all naturalists indeed acknowledge, yet who can affirm that it was so
      eighteen hundred years ago? On the contrary, since these things are
      recorded in the sacred writings, we ought to submit and believe that the
      system of Nature is changed from what it was in ancient times. This event
      probably came to pass when the sun was darkened, and the stars fell from
      Heaven, as mentioned in a former question.

      29. Your Lordships, no doubt, will readily explain and settle the
      mysterious disagreement between John the Baptist and Jesus Christ.* John
      being asked if he was Elias, answered, I am not; but Jesus** affirms, the
      contrary. As few even of the Christians have faith enough to believe that
      John was and was not Elias at the same time, a word or two of explanation
      would afford them infinite satisfaction. Commentators in divinity can do
      miracles in the way of explaining; but, unfortunately for us, all other
      miracles have long ceased, though at no time so much wanted as at present.

      30. Out of forty Gospels we receive four as canonical; the rest are the
      fruitful produce of that spirit of forgery which the Christian world has
      always been celebrated for. Their piety was indefatigable in burning the
      books of the heretics and unbelievers, and the same piety was not sparing
      in furnishing apocryphal books. It is for the salvation of mankind that
      Christianity should prevail; and how can its propagation be advanced, and
      its dominion confirmed, more than by preventing the arguments against it
      from being exposed to view? Some may indeed pretend, that this mode of
      proceeding is tyrannical, and destructive of the rights of mankind; but
      we, the faithful, insist that it is zealous and politic. How can a man be
      said to be injured, even if we allow that he is cheated, since he is
      cheated into salvation, though perhaps against his will? Yet it will be
      doing a singular service to us weaker Christians, if your Lordships will
      point out by what particular emanation of the Holy Spirit the Church was
      enabled to select the divine out of such a number of apocryphal writings.

      Our enemies, the infidels, say, that time has obliterated the primitive
      disputes on this subject, and that the sanction of custom has confirmed
      the authority of the four Gospels, which, so far from external and
      historical, have not even the internal evidence of truth. They observe,
      that the gospel of Mark, though evidently an abridgement of that of
      Matthew, yet differs from it in many very material particulars; that the
      grand circumstance of the conspiracy by which Christ lost his life, is
      told differently and discordantly by all the four. They express the
      highest astonishment that the sending of Jesus to Herod by Pilate should
      be related by Luke, and that the other three Evangelists should not only
      omit that occurrence, but relate the proceedings in this affair so as
      entirely to exclude the possibility of its insertion. They think it also
      impossible that an earthquake should rend rocks, and that many saints
      should arise from the dead, and go into the holy city, as Matthew relates;
      and yet that these great events should not only have escaped contemporary
      historians, but even the other three Evangelists. And to this they add,
      that it is particularly strange and amazing that John, who was present at
      the crucifixion,* should not only forbear to mention any one of the
      terrible appearances recorded in Matthew on that occasion, but that even
      the darkness of three hours' duration, which must have made the most
      lasting impression on every individual in Judea, should also be by him
      totally unnoticed.

      31. The malevolence and incredulity of our adversaries, the unbelievers,
      are visible in nothing so much as the criticisms they make on the
      resurrection. They complain, and with some degree of reason, that this
      most miraculous and important event, instead of possessing that
      extraordinary and uncommonly clear evidence, which its incredible nature
      requires, bears, on the contrary, every mark of a forgery. Instead of
      Christ's re-appearing to all the world, that the world might believe, he
      is said to have appeared to his disciples, who were the only men on earth
      whose evidence could be exceptionable in the case; men who already engaged
      in the attempt of forming a sect or party,* could by no means be
      disinterested in their report; the only men on earth who could be
      suspected of forgery in the present instance. These are the men, say our
      enemies, who were to preach Jesus Christ to the world, and to find
      arguments to support the fact, which Christ might have <i>uncontrovertibly</i>
      established by appearing again in public. But the generation was unworthy
      of that condescension, we reply, which they wickedly paraphrase thus:
      "God, who desireth: not the death of a sinner, left them in their sins,
      that they might die&mdash;God, who spared not his beloved Son, but gave
      him to the bitterness of death, that <i>sinners might be saved</i>, chose,
      nevertheless, to deprive all mankind of the proper <i>evidence of the
      resurrection</i>, because the Jews of that age were <i>sinners!</i>" Mercy
      is the character of the first act, but how shall we characterize the
      latter? Is the God of the <i>Christians</i> inconsistent with himself? Did
      the great and merciful Being act thus? Did he inspire four men to write
      accounts of the <i>resurrection</i>,* which disagree with each other in
      almost every circumstance? Does his divine truth bear the resemblance of
      forgery and invention, that we may shew our faith and reliance on him, by
      making a sacrifice of our reason; and believing by an act, not of the
      understanding but of the will? But why, O thou Supreme Governor! why hast
      thou given us reason, if reason be the accursed thing which we ought to
      cast from us? Or rather, is not reason the first and only revelation from
      thee; and are not those enthusiasts accursed, who, promulgating vile
      systems unworthy of thee, find their base purposes are not to be
      accomplished, till they have first deprived us of thy best gift?
